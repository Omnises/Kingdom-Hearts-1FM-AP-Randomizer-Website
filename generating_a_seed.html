            <li>In your KHFM Randomizer Software folder, find "seed_generator.exe" and open it.</li>
            <li>Once open, you'll find the following window prompting you to point out your settings file (if you don't have a settings file, read <a href="creating_settings.html">Creating Settings</a>) and your Archipelago installation folder.</li>
            <p><img src="./images/seed_generator.png"></p>
            <li>Choose your Archipelago installation directory. Usually this is "C:\\ProgramData\Archipelago".</li>
            <p><img src="./images/archipelago_folder.png"></p>
            <li>Choose your settings file, usually inside the "/Settings/" folder.</li>
            <p><img src="./images/player_yaml.png"></p>
            <li>You're also prompted to decide whether to replace the "apworld", which is the file which controls how Archipelago knows to generate KH1 seeds.</li>
            <li>You can use this to ensure that your installed KH1 "apworld" matches the one your KHFM Randomizer Software version is expecting. If you aren't sure, leave this as "Yes".</li>
            <li>Click "Start".</li>
            <li>After some time, you should see a window like the following:</li>
            <p><img src="./images/seed_generator_finish.png"></p>
            <li>Additionally, you should see a file in the "/Files/" folder called "AP_<seed_value>.zip". This is your newly generated seed.</li>
            <p><img src="./images/ap_seed.png"></p>
            <li>Extract this zip file. I usually extract it to a folder with the same name.</li>
            <p><img src="./images/extracted_ap_seed.png"></p>
            <li>Inside you'll find the following:</li>
            <ul style="padding-left:50px">
                <li>A ".archipelago" file which will open a server locally if you chose to have remote items.</li>
                <li>A ".txt" file containing the spoiler log for the generated seed.</li>
                <li>A ".zip" file for each player containing the necessary json data for generating that player's mod in OpenKH, which is used during "Generating your mod zip".</li>
            </ul>
