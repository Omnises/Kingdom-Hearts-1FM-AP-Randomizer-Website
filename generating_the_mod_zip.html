            <li>In your KHFM Randomizer Software folder, find "mod_generator.exe" and open it.</li>
            <li>Once open, you'll be greeted with the following screen prompting you to point out the seed zip your OpenKH KH1 extracted data path.</li>
            <p><img src="./images/mod_generator.png"></p>
            <li>Point our your seed zip for your slot. Importantly, this is the inner zip file inside the generated zip in "Generating a Seed" and should contain your player/slot name in the filename.</li>
            <p><img src="./images/seed_zip.png"></p>
            <li>Point out your KH1 extracted data path. Usually this is a folder named "kh1" in your OpenKH path inside the "data" folder:</li>
            <p><img src="./images/kh1_extracted_data_path.png"></p>
            <li>When both steps above are complete, you should see the following window, as well as some text output that should describe the mod creation process.</li>
