        <p>
            This is a branch of the existing randomizer that implements a lot of new features including:<br>
                <li>Worlds, spells, trinities, and summons, and stat ups are all items and thus can be placed anywhere</li>
                <li>Many checks that were previously un-randomizable or were only shuffled are now fully randomized, including Atlantica clams, static item events like Crystal Trident, Forget-Me-Not, Navi-G pieces, Postcards, Hollow Bastion carousel chests, ALL dalmatian rewards, ALL rewards from Geppetto and Pinnochio, ALL synthesis recipes, etc, etc.</li>
                <li>Fully GUI based settings/seed/and mod zip generation with full OpenKH integration.</li>
                <li>Recent additions of original randomizer features like Destiny Islands finish are now here!</li>
                <li>Options for keyblade stat randomization or full shuffle, including hidden stats like crit rate, crit str bonus, and recoil, fully displayed in the weapon description.</li>
                <li>Randomized cups with options to exclude no cups, all cups, or only Hades cup</li>
                <li>Addition of Final Rest Door Key, an item which makes the door in Final Rest appear</li>
                <li>Addition of Lucky Emblems, with settings to decide how many unlock End of the World and the Final Rest Door Key</li>
                <li>Tons of works stabilizing various crashes, such as revisiting incomplete worlds after Riku Ansem, warping out of worlds at times that would normally cause issues, sequence break soft locks, etc</li>
                <li>Option to shorten the final fights - teleporting Sora to the final cutscene after defeating Ansem 1 > Darkside > Ansem 2</li>
                <li>EXP multiplier options which change how much exp is needed to level instead of how many is acquired (making tech point farming a bit more viable)</li>
                <li>Full Archipelago support for multiworld randomizers</li>
